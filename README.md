3.  Open MATLAB.

4.  In MATLAB, navigate to the cloned repository directory.

## Instructions

### Overview

This repository contains MATLAB code for the paper titled "Preoperative Diffusion Tensor Imaging: Fiber-Trajectory-Distribution-Based Tractography for Identifying the Facial Nerve in Vestibular Schwannoma". The code implements FTD-based FN tractography.

### Usage

1.  **Dataset Preparation**:

        - Preprocess the dataset according to your requirements, if necessary.

2.  **Running the Code**:

        - Open MATLAB.

        - Navigate to the cloned repository directory.

        - Execute the main script `main_script.m` to start the application.

        - Optionally, modify the parameters in the scripts or functions to customize the behavior of the code.

3.  **Output**:

        - After running the code, a ‘.tck’ file will be generated which describes the facial nerve pathway.
